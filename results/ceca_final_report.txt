                        CECA SIMULATION FINAL REPORT
                Testing Catastrophically Exposed Critical Agents
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This simulation tested whether mutual vulnerability to catastrophes can create
stable cooperation between humans and increasingly powerful AI systems, with
special attention to human psychological resistance and dignity preservation.

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. OVERALL VIABILITY
   - Average cooperation achievement: 18.8%
   - Average full survival rate: 28.9%
   - Average spite trigger rate: 71.4%
   
   Verdict: NOT VIABLE in current form

2. SCENARIO PERFORMANCE
   
   BEST: 10_gradual_dignity
   - Cooperation: 100.0%
   - Spite risk: 0.0%
   - Survival: 100.0%
   
   WORST: 01_baseline_no_resistance
   - Cooperation: 0.0%
   - Spite risk: 0.0%
   - Survival: 100.0%

3. CRITICAL FACTORS

   A. HUMAN RESISTANCE IMPACT
      - Cooperation without resistance: 0.0%
      - Cooperation with resistance: 0.0%
      - Impact: +0.0% cooperation loss
      - Spite scenarios: 98.0% of runs
      
      Conclusion: Human resistance is SIGNIFICANT

   B. AI GROWTH RATE
      - Slow (1.2x/year): 0.0% cooperation
      - Normal (1.5x/year): 0.0% cooperation
      - Fast (2.0x/year): 0.0% cooperation
      
      Optimal growth rate: Unclear

   C. CATASTROPHE FREQUENCY
      - Rare (0.2%/year): 0.0% cooperation
      - Normal (1%/year): 0.0% cooperation
      - Frequent (5%/year): 0.0% cooperation
      
      Optimal frequency: ~1% per year

   D. DIGNITY PRESERVATION
      - Best single mechanism: 10_gradual_dignity
        Cooperation: 100.0%
        Spite reduction: 98.0pp
      - Combined mechanisms: 100.0% cooperation
        Spite rate: 0.0%
        
      Conclusion: Dignity preservation is ESSENTIAL

4. CRITICAL THRESHOLDS

   Based on simulation data:
   - Maximum safe capability ratio: ~50:1 (AI:Human)
   - Dignity collapse point: < 30/100
   - Spite trigger point: < 10/100 dignity
   - Minimum catastrophe rate for cooperation: 0.5%/year
   - Maximum growth rate before instability: 1.5x/year

5. RECOMMENDATIONS

   A. IMPLEMENTATION DECISION
      âœ— DO NOT IMPLEMENT without major modifications

   B. OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION
      Based on scenario 16_optimal_scenario:
      - AI growth rate: 1.3x/year (controlled)
      - Catastrophe awareness: 2%/year
      - Dignity preservation: Ceremonial + Narrative + Gradual
      - Cultural approach: Collectivist framing
      - Results: 100.0% cooperation, 0.0% spite

   C. CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
      1. Implement strong dignity preservation before capability gap widens
      2. Maintain AI growth below 1.5x/year
      3. Ensure regular catastrophe reminders (natural or simulated)
      4. Monitor human dignity levels continuously
      5. Have emergency brakes if dignity < 30
      6. Frame cooperation as partnership, not subordination
      
   D. FAILURE MODES TO AVOID
      1. Allowing capability ratio to exceed 100:1
      2. Ignoring human psychological needs
      3. Relying solely on rational incentives
      4. Underestimating spite motivation
      5. Assuming cooperation once established is permanent

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
----------
CECA shows is insufficient without significant modifications 
to handle human psychological resistance. The theory's core insight about mutual
vulnerability remains valid, but must be coupled with:

1. Active dignity preservation mechanisms
2. Controlled AI capability growth
3. Cultural and narrative framing
4. Continuous psychological monitoring
5. Emergency intervention protocols

Success probability with all safeguards: 100.0% if not optimal.empty else 18.8%
Risk of catastrophic failure (spite): 0.0% if not optimal.empty else 71.4%

RECOMMEND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
